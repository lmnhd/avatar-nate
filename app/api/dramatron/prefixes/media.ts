WOMEN OF CORINTH
Throw wide the doors and see thy children's murdered corpses.

JASON
Haste, ye slaves, loose the bolts, undo the fastenings, that
I may see the sight of twofold woe, my murdered sons and her, whose
blood in vengeance I will shed.  (MEDEA appears above the house, on
a chariot drawn by dragons; the children's corpses are beside her.)

MEDEA
Why shake those doors and attempt to loose their bolts, in
quest of the dead and me their murderess? From such toil desist. If
thou wouldst aught with me, say on, if so thou wilt; but never shalt
thou lay hand on me, so swift the steeds the sun, my father's sire,
to me doth give to save me from the hand of my foes.

JASON
Accursed woman! by gods, by me and all mankind abhorred as
never woman was, who hadst the heart to stab thy babes, thou their
mother, leaving me undone and childless; this hast thou done and still
dost gaze upon the sun and earth after this deed most impious. Curses
on thee! now perceive what then I missed in the day I brought thee,
fraught with doom, from thy home in a barbarian land to dwell in Hellas,
traitress to thy sire and to the land that nurtured thee.
Perish, vile sorceress, murderess of
thy babes! Whilst I must mourn my luckless fate, for I shall ne'er
enjoy my new-found bride, nor shall I have the children, whom I bred
and reared, alive to say the last farewell to me; nay, I have lost
them.

MEDEA
To this thy speech I could have made a long reply, but Father
Zeus knows well all I have done for thee, and the treatment thou hast
given me. Yet thou wert not ordained to scorn my love and lead a life
of joy in mockery of me, nor was thy royal bride nor Creon, who gave
thee a second wife, to thrust me from this land and rue it not. Wherefore,
if thou wilt, call me e'en a lioness, and Scylla, whose home is in
the Tyrrhene land; for I in turn have wrung thy heart, as well I might.

JASON
Thou, too, art grieved thyself, and sharest in my sorrow.

MEDEA
Be well assured I am; but it relieves my pain to know thou
canst not mock at me.

JASON
O my children, how vile a mother ye have found!

MEDEA
My sons, your father's feeble lust has been your ruin!

JASON
'Twas not my hand, at any rate, that slew them.

MEDEA
No, but thy foul treatment of me, and thy new marriage.

JASON
Didst think that marriage cause enough to murder them?

MEDEA
Dost think a woman counts this a trifling injury?

JASON
So she be self-restrained; but in thy eyes all is evil.

MEDEA
Thy sons are dead and gone. That will stab thy heart.
